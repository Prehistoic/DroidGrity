- Fill README.md => you can add both the following points to the TO DO, won't do them for v1

    - Make it so the user can define a handler in its code rather than crashing the application. Maybe you could also just start the dylib code with JNI_OnLoad

    - Use o-llvm to obfuscate your library when building it ?

- Create a docker image

- Run tests ! (different APKs, different arch...)
